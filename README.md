# REDCap Cypress Test Framework

This repository is a template for writing automated tests using Cypress for REDCap.  It can serve as a starting point for writing your own integration tests against REDCap.

This starting point uses the Cypress framework, a library which allows testing against a wide variety of environments. Tests are not made in platform-specific environments, so you should be able to write tests for any environment you operate in.

For specific information and documentation about Cypress, please visit their website:

## How to Write a Test

Tests for Cypress are written JavaScript.  If you know how to write JavaScript, you will have no trouble writing a test in the Cypress framework.

(Documentation in progress.  More to come.)
